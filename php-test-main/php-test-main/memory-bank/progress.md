  - Fixed ProductController SQL queries to alias `productName` as `name`, `stock_quantity` as `stock`, `catName` as `category_name`, `brandName` as `brand_name`
  - Updated store/update methods to handle form field names (`name`, `category_id`, `brand_id`, `stock`) instead of database field names
  - Fixed edit functionality to populate form correctly with aliased field names
  - Ensured database setup runs properly via `setup.php` script
- ✅ **Order Status Update Errors**: Fixed "An error occurred while updating the order status" and payment status errors (Jan 2025)
  - Fixed OrderController `updateStatus()` and `updatePaymentStatus()` methods to get orderID from URL parameter instead of POST data
  - Updated methods to return proper JSON responses for AJAX calls instead of redirects
  - Fixed parameter names to match what JavaScript is sending (`status` instead of `order_status`)
  - Enhanced error handling and validation messages
- ✅ **Revenue Calculation Issues**: Fixed dashboard showing $0.00 for "Total Revenue" and "Avg. Order" values (Jan 2025)
  - Added missing `total_revenue` and `avg_order_value` calculations to AdminController's `getAdminStats()` method

  - Dashboard now properly displays recent orders with customer names, amounts, and status
- ✅ **Admin Permission System**: Fixed "You do not have permission to access this resource" error for categories (Jan 2025)
  - Root cause: `manage_categories` permission not explicitly listed in AdminController's checkPermission() method
  - Additional issue: Permission system didn't recognize `super_admin` role (only checked for exact `admin` role)
  - Fixed by adding `manage_categories` to the list of permissions available to admin and manager roles
  - Added `super_admin` role recognition with full permissions access
  - Updated default case to accept both `admin` and `super_admin` roles
  - Categories and all other admin functions now work properly for super_admin users
- ✅ **Categories View PHP Warnings**: Fixed undefined array key "name" and htmlspecialchars null parameter warnings (Jan 2025)
  - Root cause: CategoryController using database field `catName` but view expecting `name` field
  - Fixed by adding SQL alias `c.catName as name` in CategoryController query
  - Added null coalescing operator `$category['name'] ?? 'Unnamed Category'` to prevent undefined key warnings
  - Fixed both the category name display and image alt text
- ✅ **Admin ID Sorting**: Implemented ascending ID sorting across all management pages (Jan 2025)
  - CategoryController: Changed from `ORDER BY c.catName ASC` to `ORDER BY c.categoryID ASC`
  - CustomerController: Changed from `ORDER BY c.created_at DESC` to `ORDER BY c.customerID ASC`
  - OrderController: Changed from `ORDER BY o.created_at DESC` to `ORDER BY o.orderID ASC`
  - ProductController: Already using `ORDER BY p.productID ASC` ✅
  - SliderController: Already using `ORDER BY position ASC, sliderID ASC` ✅
  - Consistent ID-based ascending sorting across all admin management interfaces
- ✅ **Category Statistics and Form Issues**: Fixed "Total Products 0" display and "Category Name undefined" in edit modal (Jan 2025)
  - **Statistics Fix**: Changed field name from `categorized_products` to `products_in_categories` in getCategoryStatistics() method to match view expectations
  - **Edit Form Fix**: Added `$category['name'] = $category['catName']` alias in get() method so JavaScript can access category.name correctly
  - **Form Field Names**: Updated store() and update() methods to accept `$_POST['name']` instead of `$_POST['catName']` to match form field names
  - **Image Upload Fix**: Changed from `$_FILES['category_image']` to `$_FILES['image']` to match form field name
  - Category management now shows correct product counts and edit functionality works properly
- ✅ **Category AJAX Form Submission**: Fixed "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'... is not valid JSON" error (Jan 2025)
  - **Root Cause**: JavaScript form submission using fetch() expects JSON responses, but controller methods were returning HTML redirects
  - **Store Method Fix**: Replaced all `header('Location: ...)` redirects with `header('Content-Type: application/json')` and `echo json_encode()` responses
  - **Update Method Fix**: Same conversion to JSON responses, also changed from `$_POST['categoryID']` to `$_GET['id']` to match URL parameter
  - **Error Handling**: All validation errors and exceptions now return structured JSON with success/message fields
  - Category create and update operations now work seamlessly with AJAX forms without page redirects
- ✅ **Category Table Schema**: Fixed "Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'updated_at'" database error (Jan 2025)
  - **Root Cause**: BaseModel automatically adds `updated_at` timestamps, but `tbl_category` table was missing this column
  - **Database Fix**: Added missing `updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` column to tbl_category
  - **Data Migration**: Updated all existing category records to have proper `updated_at` timestamps
  - **Verification**: Confirmed both `created_at` and `updated_at` columns now exist and function correctly
  - Category create and update operations now work without database errors

### Minor Issues
